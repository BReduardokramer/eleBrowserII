### What is this repository for? ###

A simple web browser using Electron and Material Design Lite.

### Features ###

* Simple interface.
* Works on macOS, Windows, and Linux without any source changes (thanks Electron!)
* A menubar-- something some modern browsers lack these days. Can be used all the time, even in YouTube's full-screen mode (hit ALT to show it when in fullscreen if not on macOS).
* Working omnibox with the ability to search with any search engine of your choice (not just Google, Bing or Yahoo). You can even completely remove the default search engine.
* Having a home page with a big honking search bar and ads for various products is not a requirement. You can set it to about:blank without any hassle.
* Does not spy on your browsing activity or "phone home"; you can inspect the source to verify this.
